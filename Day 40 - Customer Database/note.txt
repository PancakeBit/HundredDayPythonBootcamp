I'm skipping this day because it's pretty dumb,
it's just adding a "user" table to google sheets and sheety
no password verification or specific row selection.

Will implement these in the project(Day 39) eventually but not yet:
Account Creation
User Table
User column in flight table
if user is in user column, only then search for cheap flights
Step 4: if a flight is not found check to see if other flights stop over to the destination??
        I think????
very unclear step no idea what it actually wants to do
